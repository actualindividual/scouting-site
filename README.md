This is an FRC scouting app [EmilioMGithub](https://github.com/EmilioMGithub) and I made.

It uses the [QRCodeJS](https://davidshimjs.github.io/qrcodejs/) library to generate QR codes that are then scanned by another  
(iOS) app and submitted to our database, avoiding having to deal with browser security.
